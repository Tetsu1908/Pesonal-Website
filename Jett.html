<h2><strong>Biography</strong></h2>
<p>
"Representing her home country of South Korea, Jett's agile and evasive fighting style lets her take risks no one else can. She runs circles around every skirmish, cutting enemies before they even know what hit them."
</p>
From Korea comes Jett, an agile fighter who prioritizes movement over everything. Her abilities include a teleportation-based dash and an updraft that lets her reach higher ledges. She also has a smokebomb ability to hinder sightlines and a powerful Bladestorm ultimate that deals moderate-to-heavy damage and remains accurate even while she's moving.
<p>
Jett is one of the few Agents with a passive ability. Holding the jump key while in the air will allow Jett to slow her descent.
</p>
<p>
Jett's Ultimate allows her to wield several throwing knives that deal moderate damage and kill on headshots. Getting a kill replenishes your daggers and you can choose to throw them one at a time or throw all remaining daggers in a short-ranged burst.
  </p>

  </p>
<p>
  "Think you can keep up? Who am I kidding? You know you can't keep up."
</p>
<p>
  Jett is an aggressive agent who has a distinctive, sarcastic personality. Jett also has a cheeky, childish "in-your-face" attitude, seen commonly giving insults for feats she makes on the team and is always spouting her sheer amount arrogance. She does show a much more friendly personality towards teammates.
</p>
<h2><strong>Appearance</strong></h2>
<p>
Jett is a fair-skinned, short girl, being the smallest of the VALORANT agents. She has white hair, which she ties in a bun on the back. Her bangs are rather long and remain stably locked. Her eyes are a shade of blue, and she looks like she wears eyeliner. Her clothes are all in shades and tints of blue, including her darkest pieces of apparel.
